## About the Project

As it says, this project is a classic REST API with some interesting stuff such as connections to Cloudinary, Google OAuth and it uses nodemailer to send mails to users who want to register on our application. Is available to perform in every front-end you create (is also a personal project that I have).

This project runs on node.js and uses the unopinionated framework express.js.

This project is currently deployed on heroku
